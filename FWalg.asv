function D = FWalg(A)
%UNTITLED4 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

%when i and j are connected d = a_ij
%when i = j, d = 0
%when not connected d = infty


D = repmat(A,1);%copied A to D because d = 0 when i and j are connected
D(D == 0)=Inf; % 
D(eye(size(D))~=0)=0;
